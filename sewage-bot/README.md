#VPR's Sewage Twitter Bot

This bot scrapes Vermont's Water Waste Inventory site and tweets when there is an update. Follow along at [@dirtywatervt](http://twitter.com/dirtywatervt).

#Get Involved

In order to replicate this, you'll need to create a new Twitter handle and make sure it's registered as a Twitter app. Throw the keys and secrets into a config file, make sure the app has read and write access, create an empty csv file, create an empty log file, `pip install twython`, and you should be good to go.
